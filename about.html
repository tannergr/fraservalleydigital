        <h1> A little about us... </h1>
        <p>
        We are a local Digital Management company serving the Fraser Valley region of the Vancouver lower mainland.  We provide digital management services to small and medium sized businesses.
        </p><p>
        We are here to help you manage your business’s digital brand and digital marketing.
        </p><p>
        We started our company in 1996 as a software start-up, although we didn’t call them start-ups back then. During the early years, the business changed rapidly, and we became primarily focused on Internet server management, domain registrations, and E-Commerce. We have been an Google Adwords PPC service provider since 2012.
        </p><p>
        It would be cliché, but we started our company in our garage in Abbotsford in 1996.
        </p><p>
        This had always been a side business for us.  We have now completed our professional careers, so we are now devoting our full-time efforts helping local businesses manage their digital assets.
        </p><p>
        Fraser Valley Digital is a restart for us, and we are excited about working with local businesses and organizations to help them maximize their digital brands.
        </p><p>
